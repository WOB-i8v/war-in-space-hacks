# war-in-space-hacks
the ONLY war in space hacks you will find!

use middle mouse wheel to zoom in and out. (with the zoom script)

press t to toggle the scrap bot.

the scrap bot collects scrap and stays away from danger. there is a second version i am working on that can fight back instead of just running. but it is not finished yet :(

for the keybinds, it's really simple. the ships in the upgrade menu go from left to right, so the keybind go left to right with f,g,h. so if i wanted to upgrade from the base ship to the support, i would click f. no menu needed now 👍

the rest is automatic.

also, if you try putting too many of them on at once the game will lag
